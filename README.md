This simple repository is an example of reading text from a table whose columns are separated by whitespace. In this case, the table in each file have 1000 rows that each list the highest ranking names down to the lowest ranking names for a baby born in that year. The left columns are for boys, while the right columns are for girls. For each gender, both the name and the number of babies given that name are kept in a separate column. Example files have been included. To simplify the table has the following columns (in order from left to right): rank for the boy and girl name in the row, boys name (at that rank), number of boys with that name, girls name (at that rank), number of girls with that name. Higher rows indicate higher rank, and is indicated in the left-most column. Example files have been included. Note that for the program to function properly, the file names must match the naming format of "babynameranking2001" (more specifically, that the file name is 19 characters long, and the last four characters are the year that census data refers to).
